# speech2txt


Work in progress [WIP] attempt to get a Speech to text and Text to speech app working. Based from Deepspeech core.

## Backgound
- Why DeepSpeech and coqui.ai?
  - DeepSpeech codebase does not appear to be maintained and from version 0.9.3 Coqui has advanced the development of the Speech to Text [STT]
